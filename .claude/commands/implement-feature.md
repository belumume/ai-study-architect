# Implement Feature with TDD

Implement a new feature using test-driven development methodology.

Usage: /project:implement-feature <feature_description>

Follow these steps for $ARGUMENTS:

1. **Research Phase**
   - Read relevant existing code
   - Identify integration points
   - Review similar implementations

2. **Planning Phase** (think hard)
   - Design the feature architecture
   - Identify required components
   - Plan API contracts
   - Consider edge cases

3. **Test Writing Phase**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests
   - Include edge cases and error conditions
   - Ensure tests fail initially
   - Commit tests when complete

4. **Implementation Phase**
   - Implement code to pass tests
   - Run tests iteratively
   - Refactor as needed
   - Ensure all tests pass

5. **Integration Phase**
   - Write integration tests
   - Update documentation
   - Add to CLAUDE.md if needed
   - Commit implementation

Remember: Do NOT modify tests during implementation phase.
