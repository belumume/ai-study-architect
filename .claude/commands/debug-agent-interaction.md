# Debug Agent Interaction Issue

Debug issues with agent communication and interaction in the multi-agent system.

## Steps:

1. First understand the issue by reading:
   - The specific agents involved in `backend/app/agents/`
   - Their interaction patterns and message formats
   - Any error logs or stack traces provided

2. Use logging to trace the agent communication:
   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
   ```

3. Add debug breakpoints in the agent interaction code:
   - Message sending points
   - Message receiving points
   - State transitions
   - Error handling blocks

4. Write a minimal test case that reproduces the issue:
   ```python
   async def test_agent_interaction_issue():
       # Minimal setup to reproduce
       pass
   ```

5. Think through the interaction flow step by step:
   - What message is being sent?
   - What format is expected vs actual?
   - Are there timing/async issues?
   - Are dependencies properly mocked?

6. Implement the fix with proper error handling

7. Add regression tests to prevent the issue from recurring

8. Verify the fix doesn't break other agent interactions:
   ```bash
   pytest backend/tests/test_agents.py -v
   ```

9. Document the issue and solution in code comments
