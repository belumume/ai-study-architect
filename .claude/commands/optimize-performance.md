# Optimize Performance

Analyze and optimize performance bottlenecks in the AI Study Architect system.

## Steps:

1. First identify the performance issue:
   - API response times
   - AI model inference speed
   - Database query performance
   - Frontend rendering issues
   - Memory usage concerns

2. Profile the specific area:
   - For Python: Use cProfile or line_profiler
   - For React: Use React DevTools Profiler
   - For Database: Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE
   - For API: Use FastAPI middleware timing

3. Measure baseline performance:
   ```python
   import time
   start = time.time()
   # Code to measure
   print(f"Execution time: {time.time() - start}s")
   ```

4. Think about optimization strategies:
   - Caching (Redis for AI responses)
   - Database indexing
   - Lazy loading components
   - Batch processing
   - Async/concurrent operations
   - Vector search optimization

5. Implement optimizations incrementally:
   - Make one change at a time
   - Measure impact of each change
   - Ensure functionality remains correct

6. Add performance tests:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.performance
   async def test_response_time():
       # Assert response time < threshold
       pass
   ```

7. Update monitoring/logging to track performance

8. Document performance improvements and trade-offs
