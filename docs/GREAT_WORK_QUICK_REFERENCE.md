## Daily Decision Framework

Before any decision, ask:
1. **Does this follow curiosity?** If not, why are we doing it?
2. **Is this excitingly ambitious?** If not, how can we make it so?
3. **Are we being intellectually honest?** If not, what are we avoiding?
4. **Will this outlive the course?** If not, is it worth our time?

## The North Star Question
*"What would education look like if we optimized for human flourishing instead of institutional convenience?"*

## Core Principles Checklist

### When Coding
- [ ] Building diagnostic tools, not guessing?
- [ ] Choosing hard right over easy wrong?
- [ ] Documenting learning, not just code?
- [ ] Respecting privacy and security absolutely?

### When Designing
- [ ] Following genuine curiosity?
- [ ] Pushing boundaries respectfully?
- [ ] Solving root causes, not symptoms?
- [ ] Enabling human potential?

### When Stuck
1. Build tools to understand the problem
2. Question every assumption
3. Look for what's broken in current models
4. Remember: "Stop being lazy and dig deeper"

## The Graham Test
**"Will people in 20 years be unable to imagine learning without this?"**

## Quick Wins Aligned with Great Work
- Make something that excites you to work on
- Solve a problem you personally face
- Build what seems slightly impossible
- Document insights, not just features
- Share learning, not just results

## Remember
- Great work starts small and seems reasonable to you
- Others thinking it's crazy is a good sign
- Persistence powered by curiosity is the key
- The gap between "helping students" and "transforming education" is where great work lives
