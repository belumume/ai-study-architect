# Audit Verification Protocol

## CRITICAL: All Auditors Must Follow This Protocol

### Before Reporting ANY Security Issue:

1. **VERIFY the actual state** - Don't assume from file contents
   ```bash
   # Example: Before claiming "secrets are exposed in git"
   git ls-files | grep -E "\.env$"  # Check if actually tracked
   cat .gitignore | grep "\.env"     # Check if gitignored
   git log --all -- .env              # Check git history
   ```

2. **DISTINGUISH between environments**
   - Local .env files ≠ Production secrets
   - Development configs ≠ Deployment configs
   - Example files (.env.example) ≠ Actual secrets

3. **TEST your claims**
   ```bash
   # BAD: "Your API keys are exposed!"
   # GOOD: "I verified that .env is tracked in git by running: [command]"
   ```

4. **PROVIDE evidence**
   - Show the exact command/file/line
   - Include verification steps
   - Distinguish "potential issue" from "confirmed vulnerability"

## Verification Checklist for Common False Positives

### ❌ FALSE: "Secrets exposed in repository"
**VERIFY FIRST:**
```bash
# Check if file is tracked
git ls-files | grep [filename]

# Check gitignore
cat .gitignore

# Check git history
git log --all -- [filename]

# Check if it's an example file
ls -la *.example
```

### ❌ FALSE: "Database will be lost"
**VERIFY FIRST:**
```bash
# Check if database is external service
echo $DATABASE_URL  # Is it localhost or external?

# Check deployment config
cat render.yaml | grep -A5 databases
```

### ❌ FALSE: "No security headers"
**VERIFY FIRST:**
```bash
# Actually test the deployed app
curl -I https://[deployed-url]

# Check the code
grep -r "security_headers" app/
```

## Reporting Template for Auditors

### Use This Format:

```markdown
## [VERIFIED/POTENTIAL] Issue: [Title]

**Verification Method:**
- Command run: `[exact command]`
- Result: [paste output]
- Environment: [local/staging/production]

**Evidence:**
- File: [path]
- Line: [number]
- Current state: [what you found]

**Risk Level:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**False Positive Check:** [what you did to confirm]
```

## Common Audit Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Assuming .env is committed** - Always check git status first
2. **Confusing example files with real configs** - .env.example is meant to be public
3. **Not understanding deployment platforms** - Render/Vercel handle secrets differently
4. **Mixing development and production concerns** - localhost issues ≠ production issues
5. **Not checking existing security measures** - The app may already handle the issue

## Verification Commands Reference

```bash
# Security Check Commands
git ls-files | grep -E "\.(env|key|pem|cert)$"  # Find tracked sensitive files
git log --all -p -G "sk-|api_key|password"      # Search git history for secrets
grep -r "SECRET\|KEY\|PASSWORD" --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.example"

# Configuration Check Commands
cat .gitignore | grep -E "env|key|secret"       # Check what's ignored
find . -name "*.example" -o -name "*.template"  # Find example files
env | grep -E "DATABASE_URL|REDIS_URL"          # Check runtime environment

# Deployment Check Commands
cat render.yaml | grep -E "env|database|redis"  # Check deployment config
cat vercel.json                                  # Check frontend config
cat Dockerfile                                   # Check container config
```

## For This Project Specifically

### VERIFIED FACTS (Not Issues):
- ✅ .env is properly gitignored
- ✅ Production uses different keys than development
- ✅ Database is on Render (external service)
- ✅ Security headers are implemented
- ✅ JWT uses RS256 (not HS256)
- ✅ SQL injection prevention is in place

### ACTUAL ISSUES (Verified):
- ⚠️ CORS set to "*" in render.yaml (intentional for MVP)
- ⚠️ Redis not available on Render free tier (handled with fallback)
- ⚠️ Local file storage (will need cloud storage when scaling)

## Auditor Pledge

Before submitting any security audit, confirm:
- [ ] I ran actual commands to verify each claim
- [ ] I distinguished between dev and production
- [ ] I checked for existing mitigations
- [ ] I provided evidence for each finding
- [ ] I marked potential vs confirmed issues
- [ ] I didn't assume - I verified

## Example of Proper Audit Finding

```markdown
## VERIFIED Issue: CORS Wildcard in Production Config

**Verification Method:**
- Command: `cat render.yaml | grep CORS`
- Result: `value: "*"`
- Environment: Production deployment config

**Evidence:**
- File: render.yaml
- Line: 29
- Current: BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS = "*"
- Recommended: BACKEND_CORS_ORIGINS = "https://ai-study-architect.vercel.app"

**Risk Level:** Medium (for MVP), High (for production)
**False Positive Check:** Confirmed this is the actual deployment config, not an example
```

Remember: **Trust, but verify.** Every claim must be backed by evidence.
