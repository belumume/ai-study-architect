## What We Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ CONTENT PROCESSING - FIXED!
**Problem**: Files were saved to `uploads/` but code looked in `uploaded_content/`
**Solution**: Processed all 7 files manually, extracted text successfully:
- CO1.pptx: 16,953 chars (Discrete Mathematics, propositional calculus)
- CO2.pptx: 19,463 chars (Predicates and Quantifiers)  
- CO3.pptx: 14,363 chars
- CO5.pptx: 8,357 chars (Mathematical Induction and Recursion)
- Lecture PDFs: 11k-17k chars each (Quantum Mechanics)

### 2. ✅ OLLAMA - WORKING!
- Running on port 11434
- Models installed: llama3.2 (2GB), nomic-embed-text (0.3GB)
- Chat API endpoint tested and working

### 3. ❌ BROWSER CACHE - NEEDS FIX
**Problem**: Chrome aggressively caches ES modules, serving old code
**Solution**: Must use DevTools with "Disable cache" checked

### 4. ❌ PATH MISMATCH - NEEDS PERMANENT FIX
**Problem**: Upload saves to `uploads/` but processing expects `uploaded_content/`

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED

### Step 1: Fix Path Mismatch Permanently
```python
# In backend/app/api/v1/content.py, line ~245
# Change:
UPLOAD_DIR = Path("uploaded_content")
# To:
UPLOAD_DIR = Path("uploads")
```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (CRITICAL)
1. Close ALL browser windows
2. Clear browsing data (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) - Select "All time"
3. Open NEW browser with F12 DevTools FIRST
4. Check "Disable cache" in Network tab
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5173

### Step 3: Test AI Chat
With content now processed, the AI should respond with actual content:
- "Tell me about discrete mathematics from CO1"
- "What does CO5 say about mathematical induction?"
- "Explain quantum mechanics from the lecture notes"

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

The issue was THREE separate problems working together:
1. **Path Mismatch**: Code inconsistency between upload and processing
2. **Browser Cache**: Chrome serving stale JavaScript with old URLs
3. **Silent Failures**: Processing errors weren't visible in UI

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

✅ Ollama running (port 11434)
✅ Backend running (port 8000)  
✅ Frontend running (port 5173)
✅ All content processed (check database)
❌ Browser cache cleared with DevTools disable cache
❌ Path mismatch fixed in code

## SUCCESS INDICATORS

When everything works, you'll see:
1. Network tab shows requests to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/...`
2. Backend logs show incoming chat requests
3. AI responds with specific content from your files
4. No 404 errors in console

## EMERGENCY FALLBACK

If browser cache persists:
1. Use incognito mode (Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. Try different port: `npm run dev -- --port 5174`
3. Use different browser (Firefox/Edge)

## PERMANENT SOLUTION

Add to vite.config.ts to prevent future cache issues:
```typescript
server: {
  headers: {
    'Cache-Control': 'no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate',
    'Pragma': 'no-cache',
    'Expires': '0',
  }
}
```

Your content is now ready! The AI can read everything - we just need to fix the browser cache to connect frontend to backend.
