## ‚úÖ WHAT'S WORKING
1. **Backend API** - Running correctly on port 8000
2. **Ollama Integration** - AI can read and understand uploaded content
3. **Content Processing** - All 7 files processed with text extracted:
   - CO1.pptx: Discrete Mathematics (propositional logic)
   - CO2.pptx: Predicates and Quantifiers
   - CO3.pptx, CO5.pptx: More discrete math content
   - Lecture PDFs: Quantum Mechanics content
4. **Frontend Code** - Updated to use proxy correctly

## ‚ùå THE ONLY REMAINING ISSUE
**Browser is serving cached JavaScript** - Chrome is aggressively caching ES modules

## üöÄ SOLUTION - FOLLOW THESE STEPS EXACTLY

### Step 1: Complete Browser Reset
1. **Close ALL browser windows completely**
2. **Clear ALL browsing data:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`
   - Select "All time" 
   - Check ALL boxes (cookies, cache, site data)
   - Click "Clear data"
3. **Kill Chrome processes:**
   ```
   taskkill /F /IM chrome.exe
   ```

### Step 2: Restart Servers with Anti-Cache
1. **Backend (Terminal 1):**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload --log-level info
   ```
   
2. **Frontend (Terminal 2):**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev -- --force --host
   ```
   Note the port (usually 5173, might be 5174)

### Step 3: Open Browser with DevTools Cache Disabled
1. **Open NEW Chrome window**
2. **IMMEDIATELY press F12** to open DevTools
3. **Go to Network tab**
4. **CHECK "Disable cache" checkbox** ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
5. **NOW navigate to http://localhost:5173**

### Step 4: Verify It's Working
In DevTools Network tab, you should see:
- Requests to `/api/v1/...` being proxied to port 8000
- No 404 errors
- Backend terminal showing incoming requests

### Step 5: Test AI with Content
1. **Login** with your credentials
2. **Go to Content tab** - You should see your uploaded files
3. **Go to Chat tab**
4. **Click "Attach Content"** button
5. **Select a file** (e.g., CO1.pptx)
6. **Ask specific question:** "What does this file say about propositional logic?"
7. **AI should respond with actual content**, not generic answers

## üîß IF STILL NOT WORKING

### Option A: Use Incognito Mode
1. Close all incognito windows
2. Open fresh incognito (Ctrl+Shift+N)
3. Open DevTools (F12) FIRST
4. Check "Disable cache"
5. Navigate to http://localhost:5173

### Option B: Use Different Port
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev -- --port 5174 --force
```
Then go to http://localhost:5174

### Option C: Use Different Browser
Try Firefox or Edge - they may have less aggressive caching

### Option D: Nuclear Option
1. Uninstall Chrome
2. Delete Chrome user data folder
3. Reinstall Chrome
4. Use incognito mode

## üìù TEST CHECKLIST
- [ ] Browser DevTools open with "Disable cache" checked
- [ ] Frontend requests going to `/api/v1/...` (not full URLs)
- [ ] Backend terminal shows incoming requests
- [ ] Can login successfully
- [ ] Can see uploaded content list
- [ ] Can attach content to chat
- [ ] AI responds with specific content details

## üéØ SUCCESS INDICATORS
When everything works correctly:
1. Chat interface will show attached content as chips
2. AI will reference specific details from your files
3. AI will quote from the content when asked
4. Backend logs will show content being fetched

## üí° IMPORTANT NOTES
- The issue is ONLY browser cache - everything else works
- You MUST select/attach content before chatting
- DevTools "Disable cache" is the most reliable solution
- This is a known Chrome issue with ES modules

## üö® EMERGENCY CONTACTS
If you're still stuck after trying everything:
1. Post the issue at https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues
2. Include:
   - Browser console errors
   - Network tab screenshot
   - Backend terminal output

Your AI Study Architect is READY - just need to bypass Chrome's cache!
