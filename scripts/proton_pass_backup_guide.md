## üîê Why This is Secure

‚úÖ **Proton Pass Features**:
- End-to-end encryption
- Zero-knowledge architecture  
- Version history
- Cross-device sync
- 2FA protection (if enabled)
- Encrypted export capability

## üö® Critical Reminders

1. **NEVER change `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** - You already have it safe in Proton Pass
2. **DATABASE_URL** - Don't backup, Render manages this
3. **Update backup** when you rotate API keys
4. **Tag the note** in Proton Pass for easy finding (e.g., "render", "production", "api-keys")

## üìÖ Backup Schedule

- **Before**: Any MCP Server modifications
- **After**: Rotating any API key
- **Monthly**: Regular security practice
- **Always**: Before major deployments

## üîÑ Quick Verification

After saving to Proton Pass, verify you can see:
- [ ] Both AI API keys (Anthropic + OpenAI)
- [ ] Both backup provider credentials (R2 + S3)  
- [ ] Security tokens (BACKUP_TOKEN, JWT keys)
- [ ] Recovery source links
- [ ] Service ID and dashboard URL

## üéØ Using with MCP Server

Now when using Render MCP Server:
1. You have full backup in Proton Pass
2. If anything goes wrong, you can restore from Proton Pass
3. Your `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is safe and unchanged
4. Daily R2 + Weekly S3 backups continue working

## üí° Pro Tip

In Proton Pass, you can:
- Set an alias like "render-env" for quick access
- Add a password if you want double encryption
- Share with trusted team member (encrypted sharing)
- Export encrypted backup to local file if needed
