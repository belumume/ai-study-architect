# Daily Development Plan: 1-2 Hour Sessions

**Philosophy**: Consistency over intensity. Small daily wins compound into major progress.

**Your Schedule**: 1-2 hours per day, working around CS studies

**Approach**: Each session has ONE clear goal. Complete it, commit it, done.

## Session Structure (For Each Day)

### Before coding (5 min)
- [ ] Read today's goal
- [ ] Review task checklist
- [ ] Open relevant files

### During coding (45-90 min)
- [ ] Focus on ONE goal
- [ ] Write code
- [ ] Test as you go
- [ ] Don't gold-plate (good enough > perfect)

### After coding (5-10 min)
- [ ] Run final test
- [ ] Commit with clear message
- [ ] Push to branch
- [ ] Check off tasks in this file
- [ ] Feel the win!

## Progress Tracking

Update this daily:

```
Week 1 Progress: [==------] 2/7 days complete
Week 2 Progress: [--------] 0/7 days complete

Total: 2/14 days | 14% complete
```

---

## Flexibility Rules

**If you have less time (30-60 min)**:
- Pick the smallest task from today's goal
- Do just that one thing
- Still counts as a win!

**If you have more time (2-3 hours)**:
- Complete today's goal
- Start tomorrow's goal
- Don't burn out though!

**If you miss a day**:
- No problem! Pick up where you left off
- Consistency matters more than perfection

**If something takes longer than expected**:
- That's normal in development
- Split the goal across 2 days
- Update the plan as you learn

---

## Communication with Claude

**Start each session**:
```
"Starting Day X: [Goal]"
```

**I'll help you**:
- Write the code for that day's task
- Debug issues
- Explain concepts
- Keep you on track
- Celebrate the win

**End each session**:
```
"Completed Day X: [what you built]"
```

---

## Why This Works

**Small daily wins**:
- Visible progress every session
- No overwhelming tasks
- Easy to maintain motivation

**Clear goals**:
- Know exactly what you're building
- No decision fatigue
- Can start coding immediately

**Compounding**:
- Day 1: Database tables
- Day 7: Working API
- Day 14: Full extraction system
- Day 30: Practice generation
- Day 60: Mastery gates + spaced repetition
- Day 90: Complete system!

**Consistency > Intensity**:
- 1 hour/day Ã— 90 days = 90 hours
- That's 2 weeks of full-time work
- But sustainable around school

---

## Milestones

- **Day 7**: Knowledge graph extraction working
- **Day 14**: Tested with real CS50 materials
- **Day 30**: Practice problem generation
- **Day 45**: Auto-grading system
- **Day 60**: Mastery gates implemented
- **Day 75**: Spaced repetition working
- **Day 90**: First real user test!

---

## The Meta-Irony

You're building a mastery-based learning system...
...by using mastery-based learning yourself!

Each day = one atomic concept
Each week = one major skill
Spaced repetition = reviewing old code
Mastery gates = tests passing before moving on

**You're dogfooding the philosophy.** That's beautiful.
